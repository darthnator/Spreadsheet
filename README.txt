# Comments to Evaluators:
- This project will eventually be a complete spreadsheet program, but it currently only has the formula evaluator
  program in it.  As the semester continues, I will update this readme file to include what I have done.  
  For the meantime, please view the other README file for the FormulaEvaluator project.
