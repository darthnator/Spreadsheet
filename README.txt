# Comments to Evaluators:
- This project will eventually be a complete spreadsheet program, but it currently only has the formula evaluator
  program in it.  As the semester continues, I will update this readme file to include what I have done.  
  For the meantime, please view the other README file for the FormulaEvaluator project.

# Time log:

  Hours Estimated/Worked	Assignment				Note
  	15	 /	10	Assignment 1- Formula Evaluator		It turned out to be a little easier than I thought.  I had a few bugs at the end which took extra time though.
	12	 /	12	Assignment 2- Dependency Graph		I wish I started early so that I could have had more time to write more tests.  Because I think with more time, I would have written more tests.
