# Comments to Evaluators:
- I read through the entire assignments specifications and followed them to the best of my ability and understanding.
  This dependency graph keeps track of all the connections and relationships of all the cells through dependees and dependents.
  It removes and adds dependents and dependees as needed and maintains a counter (or size) of the dependency graph.

  I estimate this project to take me aproximately 10-15 hours.  Below is my hours log:
  Monday, 1/24/2021 - 5 hours
  Thursday, 1/27/2021 - 2 hours
  Friday, 1/28/2021 - 5 hours
  TOTAL = 12 HOURS
