# Comments to Evaluators:
- I read through the entire assignments specifications and followed them to the best of my ability and understanding.
  I have created a FormulaEvaluator that I believe works like a charm!  I have tested it with various different types of formulas, making sure 
  it works when its suppose to, and making sure it calls an exception when it suppose to.  I was careful to comment along as I coded and to add
  the references to where I got google's help.  Because this is the first assignment, I decided to be extra cautious with commenting and referencing.
  If you found my comments or references as "too much", please let me know.  I just want to know what is good and not good.
