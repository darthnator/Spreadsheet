# Comments to Evaluators:
- I read through the entire assignments specifications and followed them to the best of my ability and understanding.
  This formula class takes in an expression, normalizer, variable validator, and a variable lookup.  With these inputs, the Formula can evaluate the expression 
  and produce a result (either a value or an error.)  There are two types of erros that can occur.  The first is a mal-written formula.  The second is a mal-evaluated formula.  

  I estimate this project to take me aproximately 10 hours.  Below is my hours log:
  Friday, 2/4/2022 - 6 hours
  TOTAL = 6 HOURS
